the code to generate results is in garch_estimate.jl
the code to plot is in MakePlots.jl

both use a string which appends current time to output, to allow experiments
and to avoid overwriting good results. When something interesting is found,
change the name to something descriptive. Or, work on git branch to keep 
experiments separate.
